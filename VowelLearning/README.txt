Describtion of the task:

There are two vowels in this little training excercise, the red ones and the blue ones. 
The red vowels are the starting vowel of the dansih word abe (monkey).
The blue vowels are the starting vowel of the danish word Ã¦ble (apple).
These vowels are phonetically very similar. 

When the program runs, you will see a plot with 3 blue dots and 3 red dots. 
These represent vowels spoken by native danish speakers.
They are plottet in a vowel space and it is easy to see that they form two small clusters.

The program can record you producing a vowel and show you where in the space it is.
The goal of the exercise is to be able to produce a vowel that hits within or close to the intentet cluster of vowels.

How to use the program:

There are three buttons. 
The first three will play a sound. 
The first button will play the last sound that you produced yourself. Use this to compare your vowels with those of the danes.
The second and the third button will play a random vowel of the blue or the red vowels respectivly. (these are the same as those plottet)
The last button is the "Go!" button. When you click this, the program will count down from 3. 
When it say "GO!" you have to produce a vowel and hold it till it says "STOP" (2 seconds).

Then you will see a cross on the plot repressenting your vowel. 
When ever the Program says "ready to go", you can click the "Go!" button and give it a go.
